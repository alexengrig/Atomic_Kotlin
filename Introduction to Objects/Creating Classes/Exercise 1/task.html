<h2 style="text-align: center;">Creating Classes (#1)</h2><p>Implement an <code>isPalindrome()</code> function taking an instance of <code>SimpleString</code> as
an argument. <code>SimpleString</code> is a toy class used for these tasks that only has
two members: <code>length()</code> returning a length of a string  and <code>get(Int)</code>
returning a character by its index. Note that indexing starts with zero, as
with regular <code>String</code>s.</p>
