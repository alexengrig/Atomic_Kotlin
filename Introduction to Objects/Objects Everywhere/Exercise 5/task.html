<h2 style="text-align: center;">Mastering the IDE: Completion</h2><p>In Kotlin, it's easy to explore classes using IntelliJ IDEA, which has <em>code
completion</em>. IDEA attempts to complete what you're typing and show you a list
of options. After you type the dot, IDEA suggests members which can be called
on a given element. You can also call completion explicitly by pressing
<span class="shortcut">&shortcut:CodeCompletion;</span>.</p><p>Use <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:EditorDown;</span> and 
<span class="shortcut">&shortcut:EditorUp;</span> to select the required member 
and press <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:EditorEnter;</span> to paste it.</p><p>You can discover the possible operations on any class this way. You
can type the meaningful letters of the member function or property to see all 
the available members starting with these letters, or simply containing 
these letters.</p><p>Type the identifier name <code>r</code> followed by a dot, then press 
<span class="shortcut">&shortcut:CodeCompletion;</span> to see
the possible completions. Choose <code>r.sum()</code> and <code>s.reversed()</code> by typing only
the first letters and using code completion.</p>
