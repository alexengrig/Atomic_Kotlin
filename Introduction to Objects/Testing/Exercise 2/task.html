<h2 style="text-align: center;">Mastering the IDE: Comment / Uncomment</h2><p>You can comment and uncomment a line of code by using one shortcut:
<span class="shortcut">&shortcut:CommentByLineComment;</span>. 
Calling this action on an uncommented line will comment
it, calling it on a commented line will uncomment it.</p><p>Using this shortcut is much faster than commenting or uncommenting lines by
hand.</p><p>Uncomment the first <code>println()</code> command, and comment the second one using the
shortcut.</p>
