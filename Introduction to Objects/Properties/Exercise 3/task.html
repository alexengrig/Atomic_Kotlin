<h2 style="text-align: center;">Mastering the IDE: Extract Property</h2><p>Check yourself: how many times did you use the constant <code>100</code> in the code for
the previous task? When you write the code, it's better to place  constants
into <code>val</code>s, so they are easy to change if necessary. If the requirements
change so that the field's size is <code>1000 x 1000</code>, it's error-prone to change
the constant more than in one place. It's too easy to change it in one place
and forget to change it in the other, which can lead to difficult-to-find bugs.</p><p>When a constant appears in multiple places in your code, it's wise to extract
it into a property. IntelliJ Idea allows you to do this automatically. Select
the constant <code>10</code> in the code sample, and call
<span class="control"><code>Extract Property</code></span> action.
Alternatively, you can use the 
<span class="shortcut">&shortcut:IntroduceField;</span> shortcut or choose
<span class="control"><code>Refactor | Extract | Property</code></span> from the main
menu.</p><p>Select <code>Counter</code> as the target code block in the opened menu, 
make sure that <span class="control"><code>Replace all occurrences(2)</code></span> is
chosen, then press <code>Enter</code>. You'll see the constant is now declared as a
property, which is referenced from member functions. The property is declared
with the <code>private</code> modifier, which we discuss in one of the next atoms.</p>
