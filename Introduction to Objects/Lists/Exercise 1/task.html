<h2 style="text-align: center;">Lists (#1)</h2><p>The Kotlin standard library contains many functions to work with lists.
However, it's still a good exercise to implement some of them by hand.</p><p>Find the maximum value in a list of natural numbers. If the list is empty,

class that only allows you to iterate over a list's contents, get its size and
access elements by index.</p>
