<h2 style="text-align: center;">Maps (#2)</h2><p>The <code>Cage</code> class is designed to store hamsters. <code>Cage</code> has a fixed size, so you
can't put a hamster in there if it's already full. Implement
<code>takeHamsterByName()</code>. It should choose a hamster by a given name, return it
and remove it from the list of hamsters. If the element isn't present in the
list, throw a <code>NoSuchElementException</code>.</p>
