<h2 style="text-align: center;">Mastering the IDE: Column Selection Mode</h2><p>When you need to perform the same editing operation on each line among many,
it's very convenient to use several carets.</p><p>Call the action <span class="control"><code>Column Selection Mode</code></span>
or press <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:EditorToggleColumnMode;</span>. 
Alternatively, you can choose 
<span class="control"><code>Edit | Column Selection Mode</code></span> in the application
menu. Press the same shortcut to disable the mode.</p><p>Moving the caret one line up or down selecting the text (by pressing
<span class="shortcut">&shortcut:EditorUpWithSelection;</span>
or <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:EditorDownWithSelection;</span>) in
the <span class="control"><code>Column Selection Mode</code></span> adds more carets.</p><p>Swap keys and values in a map (transforming it from <code>Map&lt;Int, String&gt;</code> to 
<code>Map&lt;String, Int&gt;</code>) working in
<span class="control"><code>Column Selection Mode</code></span>.</p><p>Select the three lines specifying the map contents and switch to the 
<span class="control"><code>Column Selection Mode</code></span>. 
Note that you now have several carets. 
Try to navigate to the beginning of a line, to the end of a line, or to the end
of the word to see how these operations are applied to all the carets in all 
lines.</p>
