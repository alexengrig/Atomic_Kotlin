<h2 style="text-align: center;">Mastering the IDE: Run</h2><p>IntelliJ IDEA is a powerful tool which allows you to carry out common actions
in an efficient way. Running the <code>main()</code> function is an example of such an
action, and IntelliJ IDEA allows you to do that by clicking a shortcut. A
shortcut is a special key combination that causes a specific command to be
executed. Throughout this course, you'll learn common shortcuts.</p><p>IntelliJ Idea is a <em>keyboard-centric IDE</em>, which means you can perform all
actions using only the keyboard. We recommend learning to do everything
with keyboard shortcuts.</p><p>Click on the icon next to the <code>main()</code> function to see what shortcut is
used by your operating system to run <code>main()</code>. The key combination appears 
right after <code>run 'TaskKt'</code>. Run the <code>main()</code> function by first choosing 
<code>run 'TaskKt'</code>, then pressing the shortcut.</p>
