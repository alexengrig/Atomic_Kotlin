<h2 style="text-align: center;">Mastering the IDE: Debug</h2><p>Debugging is a powerful way to discover what's happening in your code. You can
observe intermediate states of the program and changes between these states.</p><p>Click on the icon next to the <code>main()</code> function and choose 
<span class="control"><code>Debug</code></span>.
Notice there's a special shortcut for that:
<span class="shortcut">&shortcut:DebugClass;</span>. 
The program just runs and displays the result, 
because you haven't set any points where the execution should be paused.</p><p>The points where you want to pause the execution to observe the state 
of the variables are called <em>breakpoints</em>.
To create line breakpoints in the editor first place the caret 
on the desired line of the source code.
Then do one of the following:</p><ul><li>Click the left gutter area at a line where you want to toggle a breakpoint;</li><li>On the main menu, choose <span class="control"><code>Run | Toggle Line Breakpoint</code></span>;</li><li>Press <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:ToggleLineBreakpoint;</span>.</li></ul><p>Set breakpoints on lines 4 and 5. Then begin debugging the program again and 
notice how it stops at the first breakpoint. The debug window below the screen 
shows you the values of all the variables. Continue the process by clicking on 
<span class="control"><code>Resume program</code></span> on the left of the debug window
or pressing <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:Resume;</span>. 
Notice how the value of the variable <code>x</code> changes after the assignment.</p><p>To stop the debugging process you can either finish the program and see
the result or stop in explicitly.
Press the <span class="control"><code>Stop</code></span> button to stop
the debugging process.</p>
