<h2 style="text-align: center;">Member References (#2)</h2><p>To illustrate different types of member references, we'll consider three
characteristics of natural numbers: whether a number is even, whether it's
prime (doesn't have divisors other than 1 and itself), and whether it's
perfect. The last one means that the sum of all the divisors excluding 
the number equals the number itself. For instance, 6 is the perfect number:
<code>6 = 1 + 2 + 3</code>, where 1, 2, 3 are the divisors.</p><p><code>isEven</code> is declared as extension property, <code>isPrime</code> as extension function
and <code>isPerfect</code> as top-level function. Note that we have this inconsistency
only to illustrate different types of member references.</p><p>You task is to complete the implementations, and pass the corresponding
property or function reference to different filter invocations in <code>main</code>.</p>
