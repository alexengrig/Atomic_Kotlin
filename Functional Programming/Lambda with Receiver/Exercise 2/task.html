<h2 style="text-align: center;">Lambda with Receiver (#2)</h2><p>Implement a toy function <code>buildList()</code> similar to <code>buildString()</code> which creates
a mutable list and applies actions passed in a lambda argument.
Note that there's no practical need in such function in the standard library,
just implement it as an exercise.</p>
