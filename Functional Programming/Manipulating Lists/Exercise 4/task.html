friends of friends of the person, excluding those people who are his or her
friends already.
For instance, for the following friend connections:</p><pre><code class="language-language-text">Alice - Bob
Bob - Charlie
</code></pre><p><code>getFriendSuggestions()</code> should return Charlie for Alice, because Charlie
is a friend of Alice's friend Bob and isn't yet a friend of Alice.</p><p>No friend suggestions for Alice in the following case, Bob and Charlie are
already her friends:</p><pre><code class="language-language-text">Alice - Bob
Alice - Charlie
Bob - Charlie
</code></pre>
