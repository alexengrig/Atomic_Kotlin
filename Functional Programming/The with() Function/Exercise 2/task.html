<h2 style="text-align: center;">The <code>with()</code> Function (#2)</h2><p>To better understand the difference between an ordinary lambda and
a lambda with receiver, implement the toy <code>with2()</code> function which
takes an ordinary lambda as an argument instead of a lambda with receiver.
Note that there're no function analogous to <code>with2()</code> in the standard
library, however, there're similar extension functions taking ordinary
lambdas, as explained in [Library Helpers] atom.</p>
