<h2 style="text-align: center;">Sequences (#4)</h2><p>Implement the <code>findFavouriteInstructorForStudent()</code> function.
It takes <code>Student</code> as a parameter and finds an instructor which classes this 
student takes more often. 
If there're several such instructors, the first one is returned,
if a student took no classes at all yet, <code>null</code> is returned.</p>
